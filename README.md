# DEPRICATED SEE the [mxcubecore repository](https://github.com/mxcube/mxcubecore) instead
HardwareRepository have been renamed to mxcubecore as part of final step of a refactroring
process. mxcubecore contains the exact same funtionality but the name has been changed to
something that the community thinks carries more meaning. All the work now continues in
the mxcubecore repository.

# HardwareRepository of MXCuBE 
HardwareRepository is the back-end level of [MXCuBE Qt](https://github.com/mxcube/mxcube/) and [MXCuBE Web](https://github.com/mxcube/mxcube3/)  allowing to access the beamline control system and instrumentation. It acts as a container of single python objects (called hardware objects).
